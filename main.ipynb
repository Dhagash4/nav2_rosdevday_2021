    "Hi, I'm [Steve Macenski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-macenski-41a985101/). I do a great deal of different \"robotics stuff\" at [Samsung Research America](https://www.sra.samsung.com/) as the *Open-Source Robotics, Engineering Lead*. I consult with internal Samsung robotics teams on technology and business, work on mobile robot and perception research, and lead the ROS2 mobile robotics ecosystem. I sit on the [ROS2 TSC](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Governance.html) and I am the leader of the Navigation Working Group. \n",

    "    - Basic Nav2 operation through Rviz2 using **NavigateToPose**\n",
    "    - Basic Nav2 operation through a Python3 script using **NavigateThroughPoses**\n",
