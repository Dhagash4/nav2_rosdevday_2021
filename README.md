# nav2_rosdevday_2021

This project has a step-by-step tutorial for how to work with some of the most basic features of Nav2 using a Jupyter Notebook in a warehouse environment to create a basic application.

This contains:
- A Jupyter notebook with instructions for a Nav2 walkthrough of these features
- Demo for running Nav2 in the AWS Warehouse World
- Demo for running Nav2 on a non-TB3 industrial robot
- Demo for Keepout Zones and Speed Restricted Zones
- Demo code for working with Nav2 in python3 simple autonomy application

This demonstration is overall a reasonable baseline for how to work with Nav2 with a non-default setup (e.g. non-Turtlebot3 in a non-sandbox world) for first-time users.
